# XSMP Update 5.3.0
### These are the patch notes for the update - 5.3.0.

## Main Changes

### Upgraded UI
The UI has been changed for all NPCs and the Realm GUI with new icons and updated textures.

### Faster Scripts
The realm scripts have been greatly optimised for less lag. Hence the realm should run a lot smoother from this update forwards. We have also implimented a warning message for if the realm is under too much stress and at risk of crashing.

### NPC Changes
NPC names now show up from longer distances and you no longer have to be directly looking at the NPCs to see their names. This should help with Spawn Navigation and better legibility.

### Texture Updates
Textures for NPCs, items, blocks, and more have been updated. The more noticeable changes include the removal of glass block borders, the festive themed chests and various hats.

### Model Changes
Like with the textures, the models for the NPCs and hats have been tweaked a little to reduce collisions with skins in the case of hats and other parts of the model in the case of NPCs.

### Sound Changes
The sounds for the Shroomling, Realm Guide and more have been upped in quality slightly.

### Keep Inventory
Keep Inventory has been permanently turned off. It was never meant to be on in the first place so we are sorry for any inconveniences this may cause you.

## Bug Fixes

* Going out of the overworld no longer constantly sets your gamemode to survival.
* Loading into the realm and other dimensions no longer shows the Missing Texture screen while loading.
* Lag corrections have been made with some systems in the realm scripts.
