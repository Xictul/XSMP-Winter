# XSMP Update 5.2.0
These are the patch notes for the upcoming update - 5.2.0.

## New Additions

#### 1) Cosmetics
Introducing, cosmetics! Have you ever wanted to wear a giant Top Hat or the cut off head of an innocent Shroomling? Well now you can using the new Cosmetics tab in the Realm GUI. Here are the currently available Cosmetics you can buy:

* The Top Hat - 250c
* The Cake Hat - 500c
* The Witch Hat - 750c
* The Crown Hat - 1000c

The Shroomling Hat has not been included in this list as we want players to go out and find them themselves. In future, we plan to add more cosmetic types but hats felt like a nice place to start.

#### 2) Customised UI
If you haven't already seen in the XSMP Discord, we've been working on a new dark-themed UI look for the realm and it's finally ready for release! It will probably be the first new thing you notice about the realm when you logon. Yes it's a bit of a change from what you're used but it looks so much cleaner, smoother, and well.. darker. We also changed up some other UI parts in minor ways for example the emote menu now has different highlights when hovering over emotes.

#### 3) One Player Sleep
We have finally, FINALLY got ourselves some One Player Sleep code in this pack so now, like the name implies, if one player sleeps it will automatically turn to day!

## Changes

#### 1) NPC Room Exits
Exits to the NPC Rooms have now been added so you don't need to teleport out via the Realm GUI or the Realm Commands. All you need to do now is walk back out the way you came and you'll be teleported back to the main Spawn.

#### 2) PVP Win Message
A win message will now show up on screen whenever you or the person you're PVPing wins.

#### 3) GUI Icons
A few icons in the Realm GUI have been changed to better match the thing they're meant to be describing. More texture changes to the Realm GUI will be made later on to better fit the new Customised UI as well.

## Bug Fixes

* Realm doesn't bug out 00-01am.
* Regeneration enchanting now works.
* Gamemode changer is now location based instead of tag based.
* Hostile mobs in Spawn now die every 3 seconds instead of 5.

## Release Info
The new update is planned to be released at 16:00 (4pm) UTC. If all goes to plan the realm will be back online for 16:15 (4:15pm) UTC. In the event of any disruptions, there will be an announcement on the XSMP Discord.
